# Quantum Hamming Codes

## Introduction

This repository contains resources and simulations related to the paper "On The Design of Non-CSS Quantum Error Correction Codes with High Quantum Information". If you're interested to read the full paper you can send a DM or it can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10390974).

## How to use?

To get started with the simulations, follow these steps:

**For Python Simulations**

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moefqy/quantum-hamming-codes.git
   cd quantum-hamming-codes
   ```

2. Set Up the Python Environment:

    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv_name
    source venv_name/bin/activate
    ```

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Note: Install system dependencies like Poppler if needed.

3. Run Jupyter Notebooks:

    Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Navigate to the 'notebooks' directory and open the desired notebook.

**For MATLAB Simulations**

1. Open MATLAB:
   
   Launch MATLAB and navigate to the matlab directory:

    ```matlab
    cd('.../quantum-hamming-codes/matlab')
    ```

2. Run MATLAB Scripts:
    
    Run the MATLAB scripts corresponding to the parameters you're interested in.


## Troubleshooting

   - If you encounter issues with dependencies: Ensure all required packages are listed in requirements.txt and installed correctly.
   - For errors in MATLAB scripts: Check for syntax errors and ensure MATLAB is up-to-date.
